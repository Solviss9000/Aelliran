The newest city to spring up in the Northern peninsula, Karl's Gate hosts a number of seafaring communities. Founded by a federation of traders from both further North and far South, Karl's Gate represents the closest thing there is to a free city. Each trading faction agreeing to fund the protection and prosperity of the city while maintaining their own districts.

An officially unaffiliated faction, the Wardens, manage to oversee the general peace and daily adjudication of the city. The Judges, Consulates and Keepers of the Wardens all work to police the city, prosecute any offenders and ostensibly remain impartial in their justice.

Karl's Gate is important because much of the world's commerce moves through or near this point. And it acts as the bridge between the prosperous Empire to the South and the fractious kingdoms of the far North.

Gaters consider themselves the only free peoples of the Western Peninsula, and so look down on all the other cities and their people as Imperial stooges. Never mind that the merchant families who control the city through their sizeable donations to the Wardens are far from liberal, imposing taxes and tariffs on various goods and services.
