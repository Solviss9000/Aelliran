Sharing a land border with [[Horncross]] to the South-West, the lands around [[Karl's Gate]] are, for the most part, civilized. The Eastern reaches to the river are only sparsely settled, with some small ranches and tree farms.

The Northern coast is widely considered some of the safest waters in the world. The Northern Kingdoms working hard to secure the space as a foothold to Imperial trade, many ships patrol the waters to ensure the safety of their merchant vessels and as yet the Eastern Hordes have shown no interest in seafaring.
