The people of Trond consider their city to be the "Gateway to the North", the last true Imperial city, counting the peoples of [[Sorril]], [[Horncross]], and [[Karl's Gate]] as little more than colonial bumpkins.

This is due largely in part to the presence in Trond of the 5th Imperial Legion- a fighting force set to oppose any encroachment from the Eastern Hordes or any of the various Northern Kingdoms who decide to push their way South from [[Karl's Gate]].

As little more than a trumped-up military outpost, Trond itself lacks the cosmopolitan sense of [[Sorril]], or the more grounded ways of its other, less presumptuous Northern neighbors. The upper crust of Trondan society consisting mostly of 2nd or 3rd generation military brats, who's families were sent to this remote site in the hopes that they would be wiped out by the raiding Hordes.

Owing to this, much of Trond seems a parody of Imperial fashion, decor and architecture. It is not uncommon to see the nepotistic warlords marching through the streets in clothes a few seasons passed, or to be using slang from the Empire that the commoners of [[Sorril]] have already discarded as old-fashioned.

All that being said, Trond is still a safe, marketable city, with a robust night life, many varied shops and a thriving grey and black market.
