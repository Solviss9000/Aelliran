Sitting astride the Imperial road, and being a military outpost first and foremost, Trond has heavy fortifications and almost no farmland surrounding it. A few orchards of the Trondan elite and the odd barley farm or vineyard for cultivating spirits is about the extent of the agriculture.

On a spit of land between 2 distributary flows from the remote mountain lake, Lake Bald, Trond is perfectly poised to control and inhibit travel on the North/South axis of the Western Peninsula.

A small fishing town to the East, right on Lake Bald, is their only neighbor on this small inland island.
