Being the second most powerful thieves guild in [[Horncross]], next to the [[Rumboys]], the Razors represent the softer side of theft in pickpocketing, connivance and fraud. Being decentralized, the Razors have no official leader, opting instead to use democratic methods.

This often leads to a lag in reacting to the ever-changing world around them. 

Razors are currently the only guild to incorporate the [[Imperial Constabulary]] in their protection schemes, rendering them all but immune to repercussions- so long as they stick to the agreed-upon territories.
