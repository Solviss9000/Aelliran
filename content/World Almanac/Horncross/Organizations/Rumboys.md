The generalist thieves guild of [[Horncross]], the [[Rumboys]] operate throughout the city and within a short radius around the outskirts. 

Specializing in petty theft, burglary and smuggling, the guild has made arrangements and extensive bribes to the [[City Watch]] to protect themselves from prosecution in most cases.

Led by [[Wip the Quick]], a local boy who rose through the ranks by being the most cunning and ruthless thief in the city. [[Wip the Quick]] has aspirations of uniting all the guilds under one banner, taking advantage of their larger numbers and greater combined wealth as leverage against the [[City Watch]] and the [[Imperial Constabulary]].
