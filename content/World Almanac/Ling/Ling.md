In the City of Ling many people find a place outside of societal constraints. It is a safe haven for those living on the run from many things; debtors the long arm of the law, prying eyes. The people here live as a sort of collective with an understanding that if you mess up here you don't get another chance. Many pirates have made their home here when not at sea as a place to rest and repair as well as resupply without having to watch their backs. One of the best shipyards in the world is based on this island.
