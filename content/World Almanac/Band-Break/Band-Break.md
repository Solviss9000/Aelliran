As the most remote town of the Western peninsula, Band-Break marks the farthest East you can go before hitting the Red Hills and the Eastern Range. Which means its the bare edge of civilization. There's a single tavern, a universal temple, a smithy and a dozen farmer families all struggling to get by without the Eastern Hordes or anyone else- for that matter, noticing.

Many of the current residents of Band-Break are old criminals and Imperial exiles. Having gone as far from everywhere else as they could. There is a considerable population of farmers among the Breakers, men and women who don't want to worry about the Empire looking over their shoulders. They work the land in the hopes of raising enough to feed themselves and their small community.

None of the Breakers worry about the rest of the Imperium, or [[Karl's Gate]], unless they need something they can't make or grow themselves. Visitors to Band-Break are non-existent, so any newcomers who aren't dragging their whole life along with them in the hopes of settling down are viewed with much hostility. Many Breakers worry more about a lone rider from the South or West than a whole pack of raiders from the East.
