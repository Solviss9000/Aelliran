The area around Band-Break between the mountains and the river, North of the small Lake Elm is mostly wilderness. Some young forest and occasional scrubland resist the Breaker's attempt at cultivation. There is plenty of timber to be had, and herds of deer, rafters of turkey and packs of wolves all roam the open country.

There are tales of large bear and worse closer to the Red Hills, and a few tales speak of a cave somewhere near the lake. It is said to either house a terrible she-bear sometimes called, Old Sally, or a devious witch of some kind, depending on who you talk to.

The fishing in the lake and river is still quite plentiful, though there are no passes mapped through the hills and virtually no one knows anything about the mountains beyond them.
